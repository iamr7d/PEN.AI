    "rewritten_summary": "The Tanzanian Trade Union Congress (TUCTA), the country's principal trade union federation, has issued a statement asserting that artificial intelligence (AI) technology does not currently represent a significant threat to employment within Tanzania. The TUCTA's assessment is based on observations of the current level of AI adoption and its limited integration across various sectors of the Tanzanian economy. The organization believes that the focus should be on upskilling the workforce.\nTUCTA acknowledges the potential for future disruption caused by AI but emphasizes that the immediate priority should be on equipping Tanzanian workers with the skills necessary to adapt to evolving job roles. This proactive approach, the union argues, will allow the workforce to leverage AI as a tool to enhance productivity and efficiency, rather than being displaced by it.\nThe union's pronouncement offers a counterpoint to concerns voiced in other parts of the world regarding widespread job losses due to automation and AI. The TUCTA encourages stakeholders, including government, businesses, and educational institutions, to collaborate on strategies that will ensure Tanzanian workers remain competitive in the global economy, even as AI technology continues to advance.",
