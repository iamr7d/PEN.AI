The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party. Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\" Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau. The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control – with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples. This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader. He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.\n\nWatch: Canadians react to the election result across the country\n\nAlthough Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge. Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America – a move that is sure to irk the American leader. Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May. The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney – an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession. Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state. Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test.",

    "full_text": "Prince Andrew's firm linked to controversial PPE millionaire\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Ben King Business reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images Doug Barrowman pictured with his wife Michelle Mone\n\nOne of Prince Andrew's prized business assets was administered for two years by a company controlled by the controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman, the BBC can reveal. After the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragon's Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK). Barrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers. A lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".\n\nPitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\". Documents filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.\n\nControversial associates\n\nPrince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles. The prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy. Mr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful. Mr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined £150,000 in 2022. In January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company. The National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing. Author Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"\n\nWho owns Pitch@Palace?\n\nPitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts: a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholders\n\nan international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company Both arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal. Nonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\". Earlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations. However, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name. Founded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family. But early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited. This company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it. Corporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman.\n\nGetty Images The Duke of York presents a Pitch@Palace event in 2015\n\nInvestigations into Barrowman's companies",

    "full_text": "Trans former judge plans to challenge gender ruling at European court\n\n55 minutes ago Share Save Dominic Casciani • @BBCDomC Home and Legal Correspondent Share Save\n\nAvalon Victoria McCloud, pictured in 2010 when she was sworn in as a Queen's Bench Master, stood down from High Court work last year\n\nThe UK's only ever judge to publicly say they are transgender is planning to take the government to the European Court of Human Rights over the Supreme Court's ground-breaking ruling on biological sex. Dr Victoria McCloud, who stepped down from court last year, said the judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\". She said the court had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\". Two weeks ago, judges at the Supreme Court unanimously ruled a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.\n\nSince then, interim guidance says in places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, \"trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\". Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces\n\nSupreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman\n\nDr McCloud was one of at least two trans people who had wanted to present arguments to the Supreme Court about how its outcome would affect them. Courts have the discretion to consider arguments from outside \"interveners\" - but judges often reject such interventions if they conclude they are going to hear all the relevant arguments from others. The Supreme Court considered arguments on trans issues from the human rights campaign group Amnesty International, but not from exclusively trans activists. Dr McCloud, 55, came out as trans in her twenties and is one of about 8,000 people to have legally changed the sex on their birth certificate. She went on to be a High Court Master - judges who often manage complex, expensive cases - and was publicly promoted as a symbol of the modern judiciary's diversity. She stood down a year ago, saying she could not continue her judicial work amid an increasingly difficult public debate that had led to her being singled out for abuse and criticism. Following the Supreme Court ruling, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it had given \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance. But Dr McCloud said that far from clarifying the law, the court had not considered how such an outcome would impact the lives of trans people.\n\nDr Victoria McCloud speaking to the BBC over a video link on Monday\n\n\"Trans people were wholly excluded from this court case,\" said Dr McCloud. \"I applied to be heard. Two of us did. We were refused. \"[The court] heard no material going to the question of the proportionality and the impact on trans people. It didn't hear evidence from us. \"The Supreme Court failed in my view, adequately, to think about human rights points.\" Dr McCloud says she and other campaigners will go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to seek a declaration that the actions of the UK government and Supreme Court judgement \"violate [her] fundamental human rights\". \"Just as the prime minister didn't know what a woman was, actually the Supreme Court don't know because they haven't defined biological sex,\" said the former judge. \"The answer [in my view] is that a woman in law is someone with the letter F on her birth certificate.\" Dr McCloud has a Gender Recognition Certificate - which means her acquired female gender is recorded on her birth certificate. At the same time, the Supreme Court ruling means she is defined as a man for the purposes of the Equality Act. In its judgement, the court said biological sex refers to \"the sex of a person at birth\". It emphasises that only women can be pregnant, for example, and women have specific legal protection during pregnancy. Trans campaigners argue the court did not take into account their view of the complexities of biology. They argue it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary. However, gender-critical campaigners say biology comes down to a common-sense assessment of what makes a man or a woman.\n\nPA Media Campaigners from For Women Scotland celebrate the Supreme Court's judgement earlier this month\n\n\"[This judgement] has left me two sexes at once, which is a nonsense and ironic, because the Supreme Court said that sex was binary,\" said Dr McCloud. \"I am a woman for all purposes in law, but [now under this judgement] I'm a man for the Equality Act 2010. So I have to probably guess on any given occasion which sex I am.\" The equalities watchdog's interim guidance says trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities. It also means trans men - women who have transitioned to being men - have to use women's spaces. The guidance states that \"in some circumstances the law also allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use the men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use the women's facilities\". For example, trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance\", the watchdog told the BBC. The guidance adds: \"Where facilities are available to both men and women, trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use.\"",

    "full_text": "Graduates turned down by supermarkets as vacancies drop\n\n10 hours ago Share Save Kirsty Grant & Jennifer Meierhans BBC News reporters Share Save\n\nFaisa Ali Tarabi Faisa has been looking for work for 15 months\n\nYoung people have told the BBC they are finding it harder than ever to get a job, with some graduates frustrated at being turned down for roles at supermarkets. The government says getting more young people into work is a priority but UK job vacancies are at their lowest level in nearly four years. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents supermarkets, told the BBC young people would be hit hardest as firms cut back on hiring because of rising employer costs and forthcoming changes to workers' rights. Faisa Ali Tarabi, 24, from Bolton said she had gone through Aldi's recruitment process only to be told there was no suitable vacancy.\n\nShe has a degree in accounting and finance from the University of Salford and a masters in management from Manchester Metropolitan University Looking for work since she finished her masters in January 2024, she estimates she has applied for around 2,000 roles. \"I've been without work for 15 months now, and to be honest, I'm not just looking for work with my degrees now. I'm trying to get whatever I can for the time being.\" Faisa says she applied for a job at an Aldi warehouse in March 2024 but she showed the BBC an email from the store's recruitment team saying: \"You've done really well so far, however we do not currently have a vacancy that fully meets your requirements.\" It said \"all is not lost though\" and said recruiters would be back in touch if a potential vacancy came up in the next 12 months. She says she has not heard anything since. The BBC has asked Aldi for a comment.\n\nIn February we reported that more 16-24 year-olds were not in work, education or training at the end of 2024 than at any point in the past 11 years. That is 13.4%, or almost one out of every seven people in that age range, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Faisa was one of hundreds of people who commented on this report on BBC News TikTok saying their unemployment was not for want of trying. \"I check every day, there are no jobs,\" one user said. Another said: \"Finished my uni degree and can't find one job within the field I studied for.\" A third user posted: \"Young people aren't fussy we literally can't even get hired cleaning toilets.\"\n\nThe number of jobs on offer in the UK fell to 781,000 in the first three months of the year, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Some experts believe the rising cost of employing people is making businesses hold back on hiring new staff. In April the rate of employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) went up and so did minimum wages across different age groups. Business groups have also called for urgent changes to the forthcoming Employment Rights Bill over concerns it could hit hiring. Under the new law being scrutinised in the House of Lords on Tuesday, company bosses will be required to offer a zero-hours worker a guaranteed-hours contract based on the hours they clock up during a 12-week period. The biggest concern among retail HR directors is that this risks making it much harder to offer people part-time jobs, according to a BRC survey. It surveyed HR directors at 30 businesses, together employing 585,000 retail workers. Just over half said the law change would result in a reduction in staff numbers in their business, while 61% said the new law would reduce flexibility in job offerings.\n\nBRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: \"Almost 250,000 jobs have been lost in retail over the last five years and many major retailers have already announced further job cuts on the back of increased costs of employment which kicked in in April.\" She said part-time roles were down by 200,000 since 2017. \"These roles, which provide vital entry points into work for students, carers and returners, are set to be hardest hit,\" she said. \"In its current form the Employment Rights Bill could backfire, putting the brakes on hiring, or worse still, putting retail job numbers further into reverse.\"\n\nAmy Wilkes Amy says not hearing back about job applications can feel \"impossible\" but says you must not give up\n\nIn November we spoke to Amy Wilkes, 23, from Coventry who was struggling to find a job after getting a degree in criminology, policing and investigation. She says she applied for supermarket roles but did not get a response. \"It was feeling impossible,\" she says. \"What really hurt me was the not hearing back because you don't get any feedback to tell you where you're going wrong.\" After seven months Amy secured a job as a support worker, which she will start in July. \"It was a surreal moment when I found out. I was in absolute shock, quite emotional but very thrilled,\" she says. Her biggest piece of advice to others looking for work is \"don't give up\". \"I know it's really hard but there is a job out there for you,\" she says. \"Think about what you can offer - that helped my confidence to think about myself and knowing my value and what I could bring to a company.\"\n\nA government spokesperson said its new \"youth guarantee\" was \"providing every 18-21-year-old in England with access to an apprenticeship, quality training and education opportunities or help to find a job\". It said its decisions, including to raise employer NICs, were necessary to \"stabilise the public finances\" to fund services like the NHS. They added that business could claim employer NICs relief for some eligible staff including those aged under 21 and for apprentices under the age of 25.\n\nSix expert tips for finding work",

    "full_text": "Men should help carry out mammograms - experts\n\nMammograms can only be undertaken by female radiographers currently\n\nSally Reed, 67, who had two mastectomies after mammograms revealed breast cancer, told the BBC that \"if something can save your life you should go for it\" - whether it's administered by a woman or man.\n\nThe Society of Radiographers (SoR) has called for a change in policy due to \"critical\" staff shortages among radiographers who specialise in this area.\n\nX-rays called mammograms are offered to women between the age of 50 and 71 every three years to check for signs of cancer, but can currently only be performed by female staff.\n\nMale health workers should be allowed to perform breast screening examinations to help relieve staff shortages, say experts.\n\n'I may not have been here today without mammogram'\n\nBut Sally also admits women who already don't want to go for breast screening \"would definitely be turned off by a man\".\n\nBreast X-rays, which look for cancers that are too small to see or feel, are only permitted to be undertaken by female health workers. Mammography is the only health examination carried out exclusively by female staff.\n\nAccording to radiographers, the vacancy rate among mammographers who specialise in breast exams is 17.5%.\n\nAmong mammographers who assess women who have found a lump in their breast or have a family history of breast cancer, the figure is 20%.\n\nIt takes three to four years to qualify as a radiographer through a university degree.\n\nChanges to staffing were being discussed at the annual SoR conference, with discussions also taking place over whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening programme.\n\nSue Johnson, who represents the SoR, told the BBC: \"The role of the radiographer has developed and evolved and there is a much broader scope to the job role than simply taking the images.\n\n\"It's a very desirable and enjoyable career and men are saying 'we would like to access that same career and we could help deliver the service'\".\n\nJohnson said she believes this could help the recruitment of more radiographers and open up the job to more qualified people because \"mammography doesn't get as much publicity\" as other health professions.\n\nThe prospect of men performing mammograms has been explored unsuccessfully in the past, but Johnson believes \"the world has changed\" and that \"the time is right\" to start reconsidering the role.\n\nShe says women would still be given a choice on who conducted their mammogram if they didn't feel comfortable with a man doing it.\n\nMs Reed said having two mammograms 15 years apart were responsible for \"saving\" her life.\n\nShe's now had two mastectomies after two separate breast cancer diagnoses.\n\nBecause of what she's gone through, having a male radiographer \"wouldn't bother me at all\", she says.\n\nBut Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she believed \"most if not all\" women would want the \"very intimate\" screenings done by another woman, speaking from her own experience.\n\nThe focus should be on recruiting more radiographers rather than expecting women to \"compromise on their privacy and dignity,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",

The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party. Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\" Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau. The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control – with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples. This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader. He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.\n\nWatch: Canadians react to the election result across the country\n\nAlthough Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge. Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America – a move that is sure to irk the American leader. Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May. The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney – an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession. Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state. Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test.",

    "full_text": "Prince Andrew's firm linked to controversial PPE millionaire\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Ben King Business reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images Doug Barrowman pictured with his wife Michelle Mone\n\nOne of Prince Andrew's prized business assets was administered for two years by a company controlled by the controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman, the BBC can reveal. After the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragon's Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK). Barrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers. A lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".\n\nPitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\". Documents filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.\n\nControversial associates\n\nPrince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles. The prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy. Mr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful. Mr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined £150,000 in 2022. In January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company. The National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing. Author Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"\n\nWho owns Pitch@Palace?\n\nPitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts: a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholders\n\nan international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company Both arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal. Nonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\". Earlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations. However, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name. Founded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family. But early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited. This company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it. Corporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman.\n\nGetty Images The Duke of York presents a Pitch@Palace event in 2015\n\nInvestigations into Barrowman's companies",

    "full_text": "Graduates turned down by supermarkets as vacancies drop\n\n11 hours ago Share Save Kirsty Grant & Jennifer Meierhans BBC News reporters Share Save\n\nFaisa Ali Tarabi Faisa has been looking for work for 15 months\n\nYoung people have told the BBC they are finding it harder than ever to get a job, with some graduates frustrated at being turned down for roles at supermarkets. The government says getting more young people into work is a priority but UK job vacancies are at their lowest level in nearly four years. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents supermarkets, told the BBC young people would be hit hardest as firms cut back on hiring because of rising employer costs and forthcoming changes to workers' rights. Faisa Ali Tarabi, 24, from Bolton said she had gone through Aldi's recruitment process only to be told there was no suitable vacancy.\n\nShe has a degree in accounting and finance from the University of Salford and a masters in management from Manchester Metropolitan University Looking for work since she finished her masters in January 2024, she estimates she has applied for around 2,000 roles. \"I've been without work for 15 months now, and to be honest, I'm not just looking for work with my degrees now. I'm trying to get whatever I can for the time being.\" Faisa says she applied for a job at an Aldi warehouse in March 2024 but she showed the BBC an email from the store's recruitment team saying: \"You've done really well so far, however we do not currently have a vacancy that fully meets your requirements.\" It said \"all is not lost though\" and said recruiters would be back in touch if a potential vacancy came up in the next 12 months. She says she has not heard anything since. The BBC has asked Aldi for a comment.\n\nIn February we reported that more 16-24 year-olds were not in work, education or training at the end of 2024 than at any point in the past 11 years. That is 13.4%, or almost one out of every seven people in that age range, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Faisa was one of hundreds of people who commented on this report on BBC News TikTok saying their unemployment was not for want of trying. \"I check every day, there are no jobs,\" one user said. Another said: \"Finished my uni degree and can't find one job within the field I studied for.\" A third user posted: \"Young people aren't fussy we literally can't even get hired cleaning toilets.\"\n\nThe number of jobs on offer in the UK fell to 781,000 in the first three months of the year, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Some experts believe the rising cost of employing people is making businesses hold back on hiring new staff. In April the rate of employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) went up and so did minimum wages across different age groups. Business groups have also called for urgent changes to the forthcoming Employment Rights Bill over concerns it could hit hiring. Under the new law being scrutinised in the House of Lords on Tuesday, company bosses will be required to offer a zero-hours worker a guaranteed-hours contract based on the hours they clock up during a 12-week period. The biggest concern among retail HR directors is that this risks making it much harder to offer people part-time jobs, according to a BRC survey. It surveyed HR directors at 30 businesses, together employing 585,000 retail workers. Just over half said the law change would result in a reduction in staff numbers in their business, while 61% said the new law would reduce flexibility in job offerings.\n\nBRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: \"Almost 250,000 jobs have been lost in retail over the last five years and many major retailers have already announced further job cuts on the back of increased costs of employment which kicked in in April.\" She said part-time roles were down by 200,000 since 2017. \"These roles, which provide vital entry points into work for students, carers and returners, are set to be hardest hit,\" she said. \"In its current form the Employment Rights Bill could backfire, putting the brakes on hiring, or worse still, putting retail job numbers further into reverse.\"\n\nAmy Wilkes Amy says not hearing back about job applications can feel \"impossible\" but says you must not give up\n\nIn November we spoke to Amy Wilkes, 23, from Coventry who was struggling to find a job after getting a degree in criminology, policing and investigation. She says she applied for supermarket roles but did not get a response. \"It was feeling impossible,\" she says. \"What really hurt me was the not hearing back because you don't get any feedback to tell you where you're going wrong.\" After seven months Amy secured a job as a support worker, which she will start in July. \"It was a surreal moment when I found out. I was in absolute shock, quite emotional but very thrilled,\" she says. Her biggest piece of advice to others looking for work is \"don't give up\". \"I know it's really hard but there is a job out there for you,\" she says. \"Think about what you can offer - that helped my confidence to think about myself and knowing my value and what I could bring to a company.\"\n\nA government spokesperson said its new \"youth guarantee\" was \"providing every 18-21-year-old in England with access to an apprenticeship, quality training and education opportunities or help to find a job\". It said its decisions, including to raise employer NICs, were necessary to \"stabilise the public finances\" to fund services like the NHS. They added that business could claim employer NICs relief for some eligible staff including those aged under 21 and for apprentices under the age of 25.\n\nSix expert tips for finding work",

Mammography is the only health examination carried out exclusively by female staff.\n\nAccording to radiographers, the vacancy rate among mammographers who specialise in breast exams is 17.5%.\n\nAmong mammographers who assess women who have found a lump in their breast or have a family history of breast cancer, the figure is 20%.\n\nIt takes three to four years to qualify as a radiographer through a university degree.\n\nChanges to staffing were being discussed at the annual SoR conference, with discussions also taking place over whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening programme.\n\nSue Johnson, who represents the SoR, told the BBC: \"The role of the radiographer has developed and evolved and there is a much broader scope to the job role than simply taking the images.\n\n\"It's a very desirable and enjoyable career and men are saying 'we would like to access that same career and we could help deliver the service'\".\n\nJohnson said she believes this could help the recruitment of more radiographers and open up the job to more qualified people because \"mammography doesn't get as much publicity\" as other health professions.\n\nThe prospect of men performing mammograms has been explored unsuccessfully in the past, but Johnson believes \"the world has changed\" and that \"the time is right\" to start reconsidering the role.\n\nShe says women would still be given a choice on who conducted their mammogram if they didn't feel comfortable with a man doing it.\n\nMs Reed said having two mammograms 15 years apart were responsible for \"saving\" her life.\n\nShe's now had two mastectomies after two separate breast cancer diagnoses.\n\nBecause of what she's gone through, having a male radiographer \"wouldn't bother me at all\", she says.\n\nBut Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she believed \"most if not all\" women would want the \"very intimate\" screenings done by another woman, speaking from her own experience.\n\nThe focus should be on recruiting more radiographers rather than expecting women to \"compromise on their privacy and dignity,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",

The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party. Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\" Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau. The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control – with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples. This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader. He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.\n\nWatch: Canadians react to the election result across the country\n\nAlthough Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge. Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America – a move that is sure to irk the American leader. Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May. The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney – an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession. Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state. Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test.",

    "full_text": "Graduates turned down by supermarkets as vacancies drop\n\n11 hours ago Share Save Kirsty Grant & Jennifer Meierhans BBC News reporters Share Save\n\nFaisa Ali Tarabi Faisa has been looking for work for 15 months\n\nYoung people have told the BBC they are finding it harder than ever to get a job, with some graduates frustrated at being turned down for roles at supermarkets. The government says getting more young people into work is a priority but UK job vacancies are at their lowest level in nearly four years. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents supermarkets, told the BBC young people would be hit hardest as firms cut back on hiring because of rising employer costs and forthcoming changes to workers' rights. Faisa Ali Tarabi, 24, from Bolton said she had gone through Aldi's recruitment process only to be told there was no suitable vacancy.\n\nShe has a degree in accounting and finance from the University of Salford and a masters in management from Manchester Metropolitan University Looking for work since she finished her masters in January 2024, she estimates she has applied for around 2,000 roles. \"I've been without work for 15 months now, and to be honest, I'm not just looking for work with my degrees now. I'm trying to get whatever I can for the time being.\" Faisa says she applied for a job at an Aldi warehouse in March 2024 but she showed the BBC an email from the store's recruitment team saying: \"You've done really well so far, however we do not currently have a vacancy that fully meets your requirements.\" It said \"all is not lost though\" and said recruiters would be back in touch if a potential vacancy came up in the next 12 months. She says she has not heard anything since. The BBC has asked Aldi for a comment.\n\nIn February we reported that more 16-24 year-olds were not in work, education or training at the end of 2024 than at any point in the past 11 years. That is 13.4%, or almost one out of every seven people in that age range, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Faisa was one of hundreds of people who commented on this report on BBC News TikTok saying their unemployment was not for want of trying. \"I check every day, there are no jobs,\" one user said. Another said: \"Finished my uni degree and can't find one job within the field I studied for.\" A third user posted: \"Young people aren't fussy we literally can't even get hired cleaning toilets.\"\n\nThe number of jobs on offer in the UK fell to 781,000 in the first three months of the year, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Some experts believe the rising cost of employing people is making businesses hold back on hiring new staff. In April the rate of employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) went up and so did minimum wages across different age groups. Business groups have also called for urgent changes to the forthcoming Employment Rights Bill over concerns it could hit hiring. Under the new law being scrutinised in the House of Lords on Tuesday, company bosses will be required to offer a zero-hours worker a guaranteed-hours contract based on the hours they clock up during a 12-week period. The biggest concern among retail HR directors is that this risks making it much harder to offer people part-time jobs, according to a BRC survey. It surveyed HR directors at 30 businesses, together employing 585,000 retail workers. Just over half said the law change would result in a reduction in staff numbers in their business, while 61% said the new law would reduce flexibility in job offerings.\n\nBRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: \"Almost 250,000 jobs have been lost in retail over the last five years and many major retailers have already announced further job cuts on the back of increased costs of employment which kicked in in April.\" She said part-time roles were down by 200,000 since 2017. \"These roles, which provide vital entry points into work for students, carers and returners, are set to be hardest hit,\" she said. \"In its current form the Employment Rights Bill could backfire, putting the brakes on hiring, or worse still, putting retail job numbers further into reverse.\"\n\nAmy Wilkes Amy says not hearing back about job applications can feel \"impossible\" but says you must not give up\n\nIn November we spoke to Amy Wilkes, 23, from Coventry who was struggling to find a job after getting a degree in criminology, policing and investigation. She says she applied for supermarket roles but did not get a response. \"It was feeling impossible,\" she says. \"What really hurt me was the not hearing back because you don't get any feedback to tell you where you're going wrong.\" After seven months Amy secured a job as a support worker, which she will start in July. \"It was a surreal moment when I found out. I was in absolute shock, quite emotional but very thrilled,\" she says. Her biggest piece of advice to others looking for work is \"don't give up\". \"I know it's really hard but there is a job out there for you,\" she says. \"Think about what you can offer - that helped my confidence to think about myself and knowing my value and what I could bring to a company.\"\n\nA government spokesperson said its new \"youth guarantee\" was \"providing every 18-21-year-old in England with access to an apprenticeship, quality training and education opportunities or help to find a job\". It said its decisions, including to raise employer NICs, were necessary to \"stabilise the public finances\" to fund services like the NHS. They added that business could claim employer NICs relief for some eligible staff including those aged under 21 and for apprentices under the age of 25.\n\nSix expert tips for finding work",

    "full_text": "Men should help carry out mammograms - experts\n\nMammograms can only be undertaken by female radiographers currently\n\nSally Reed, 67, who had two mastectomies after mammograms revealed breast cancer, told the BBC that \"if something can save your life you should go for it\" - whether it's administered by a woman or man.\n\nThe Society of Radiographers (SoR) has called for a change in policy due to \"critical\" staff shortages among radiographers who specialise in this area.\n\nX-rays called mammograms are offered to women between the age of 50 and 71 every three years to check for signs of cancer, but can currently only be performed by female staff.\n\nMale health workers should be allowed to perform breast screening examinations to help relieve staff shortages, say experts.\n\n'I may not have been here today without mammogram'\n\nBut Sally also admits women who already don't want to go for breast screening \"would definitely be turned off by a man\".\n\nBreast X-rays, which look for cancers that are too small to see or feel, are only permitted to be undertaken by female health workers. Mammography is the only health examination carried out exclusively by female staff.\n\nAccording to radiographers, the vacancy rate among mammographers who specialise in breast exams is 17.5%.\n\nAmong mammographers who assess women who have found a lump in their breast or have a family history of breast cancer, the figure is 20%.\n\nIt takes three to four years to qualify as a radiographer through a university degree.\n\nChanges to staffing were being discussed at the annual SoR conference, with discussions also taking place over whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening programme.\n\nSue Johnson, who represents the SoR, told the BBC: \"The role of the radiographer has developed and evolved and there is a much broader scope to the job role than simply taking the images.\n\n\"It's a very desirable and enjoyable career and men are saying 'we would like to access that same career and we could help deliver the service'\".\n\nJohnson said she believes this could help the recruitment of more radiographers and open up the job to more qualified people because \"mammography doesn't get as much publicity\" as other health professions.\n\nThe prospect of men performing mammograms has been explored unsuccessfully in the past, but Johnson believes \"the world has changed\" and that \"the time is right\" to start reconsidering the role.\n\nShe says women would still be given a choice on who conducted their mammogram if they didn't feel comfortable with a man doing it.\n\nMs Reed said having two mammograms 15 years apart were responsible for \"saving\" her life.\n\nShe's now had two mastectomies after two separate breast cancer diagnoses.\n\nBecause of what she's gone through, having a male radiographer \"wouldn't bother me at all\", she says.\n\nBut Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she believed \"most if not all\" women would want the \"very intimate\" screenings done by another woman, speaking from her own experience.\n\nThe focus should be on recruiting more radiographers rather than expecting women to \"compromise on their privacy and dignity,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",

    "full_text": "Trump made Carney's turnaround victory possible\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Anthony Zurcher • @awzurcher North America correspondent Share Save\n\nWatch: Liberal Party wins - how Canada's election night unfolded\n\nMark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a remarkable victory in the Canadian election – and it appears to have come with a big assist from Donald Trump. The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party. Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\" Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau. The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control – with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples. This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader. He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.\n\nWatch: Canadians react to the election result across the country\n\nAlthough Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge. Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America – a move that is sure to irk the American leader. Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May. The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney – an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession. Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state. Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test.",

    "full_text": "Trans former judge plans to challenge gender ruling at European court\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Dominic Casciani • @BBCDomC Home and Legal Correspondent Share Save\n\nAvalon Victoria McCloud, pictured in 2010 when she was sworn in as a Queen's Bench Master, stood down from High Court work last year\n\nThe UK's only ever judge to publicly say they are transgender is planning to take the government to the European Court of Human Rights over the Supreme Court's ground-breaking ruling on biological sex. Dr Victoria McCloud, who stepped down from court last year, said the judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\". She said the court had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\". Two weeks ago, judges at the Supreme Court unanimously ruled a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.\n\nSince then, interim guidance says in places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, \"trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\". Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces\n\nSupreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman\n\nDr McCloud was one of at least two trans people who had wanted to present arguments to the Supreme Court about how its outcome would affect them. Courts have the discretion to consider arguments from outside \"interveners\" - but judges often reject such interventions if they conclude they are going to hear all the relevant arguments from others. The Supreme Court considered arguments on trans issues from the human rights campaign group Amnesty International, but not from exclusively trans activists. Dr McCloud, 55, came out as trans in her twenties and is one of about 8,000 people to have legally changed the sex on their birth certificate. She went on to be a High Court Master - judges who often manage complex, expensive cases - and was publicly promoted as a symbol of the modern judiciary's diversity. She stood down a year ago, saying she could not continue her judicial work amid an increasingly difficult public debate that had led to her being singled out for abuse and criticism. Following the Supreme Court ruling, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it had given \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance. But Dr McCloud said that far from clarifying the law, the court had not considered how such an outcome would impact the lives of trans people.\n\nDr Victoria McCloud speaking to the BBC over a video link on Monday\n\n\"Trans people were wholly excluded from this court case,\" said Dr McCloud. \"I applied to be heard. Two of us did. We were refused. \"[The court] heard no material going to the question of the proportionality and the impact on trans people. It didn't hear evidence from us. \"The Supreme Court failed in my view, adequately, to think about human rights points.\" Dr McCloud says she and other campaigners will go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to seek a declaration that the actions of the UK government and Supreme Court judgement \"violate [her] fundamental human rights\". \"Just as the prime minister didn't know what a woman was, actually the Supreme Court don't know because they haven't defined biological sex,\" said the former judge. \"The answer [in my view] is that a woman in law is someone with the letter F on her birth certificate.\" Dr McCloud has a Gender Recognition Certificate - which means her acquired female gender is recorded on her birth certificate. At the same time, the Supreme Court ruling means she is defined as a man for the purposes of the Equality Act. In its judgement, the court said biological sex refers to \"the sex of a person at birth\". It emphasises that only women can be pregnant, for example, and women have specific legal protection during pregnancy. Trans campaigners argue the court did not take into account their view of the complexities of biology. They argue it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary. However, gender-critical campaigners say biology comes down to a common-sense assessment of what makes a man or a woman.\n\nPA Media Campaigners from For Women Scotland celebrate the Supreme Court's judgement earlier this month\n\n\"[This judgement] has left me two sexes at once, which is a nonsense and ironic, because the Supreme Court said that sex was binary,\" said Dr McCloud. \"I am a woman for all purposes in law, but [now under this judgement] I'm a man for the Equality Act 2010. So I have to probably guess on any given occasion which sex I am.\" The equalities watchdog's interim guidance says trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities. It also means trans men - women who have transitioned to being men - have to use women's spaces. The guidance states that \"in some circumstances the law also allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use the men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use the women's facilities\". For example, trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance\", the watchdog told the BBC. The guidance adds: \"Where facilities are available to both men and women, trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use.\"",

    "full_text": "Prince Andrew's firm linked to controversial PPE millionaire\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Ben King Business reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images Doug Barrowman pictured with his wife Michelle Mone\n\nOne of Prince Andrew's prized business assets was administered for two years by a company controlled by the controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman, the BBC can reveal. After the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK). Barrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers. A lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".\n\nPitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\". Documents filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.\n\nControversial associates\n\nPrince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles. The prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy. Mr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful. Mr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined £150,000 in 2022. In January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company. The National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing. Author Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"\n\nWho owns Pitch@Palace?\n\nPitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts: a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholders\n\nan international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company Both arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal. Nonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\". Earlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations. However, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name. Founded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family. But early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited. This company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it. Corporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman.\n\nGetty Images The Duke of York presents a Pitch@Palace event in 2015\n\nInvestigations into Barrowman's companies",

    "full_text": "Trump made Carney's turnaround victory possible\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Anthony Zurcher • @awzurcher North America correspondent Share Save\n\nWatch: Liberal Party wins - how Canada's election night unfolded\n\nMark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a remarkable victory in the Canadian election – and it appears to have come with a big assist from Donald Trump. The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party. Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\" Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau. The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control – with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples. This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader. He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.\n\nWatch: Canadians react to the election result across the country\n\nAlthough Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge. Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America – a move that is sure to irk the American leader. Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May. The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney – an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession. Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state. Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test.",

    "full_text": "Graduates turned down by supermarkets as vacancies drop\n\n12 hours ago Share Save Kirsty Grant & Jennifer Meierhans BBC News reporters Share Save\n\nFaisa Ali Tarabi Faisa has been looking for work for 15 months\n\nYoung people have told the BBC they are finding it harder than ever to get a job, with some graduates frustrated at being turned down for roles at supermarkets. The government says getting more young people into work is a priority but UK job vacancies are at their lowest level in nearly four years. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents supermarkets, told the BBC young people would be hit hardest as firms cut back on hiring because of rising employer costs and forthcoming changes to workers' rights. Faisa Ali Tarabi, 24, from Bolton said she had gone through Aldi's recruitment process only to be told there was no suitable vacancy.\n\nShe has a degree in accounting and finance from the University of Salford and a masters in management from Manchester Metropolitan University Looking for work since she finished her masters in January 2024, she estimates she has applied for around 2,000 roles. \"I've been without work for 15 months now, and to be honest, I'm not just looking for work with my degrees now. I'm trying to get whatever I can for the time being.\" Faisa says she applied for a job at an Aldi warehouse in March 2024 but she showed the BBC an email from the store's recruitment team saying: \"You've done really well so far, however we do not currently have a vacancy that fully meets your requirements.\" It said \"all is not lost though\" and said recruiters would be back in touch if a potential vacancy came up in the next 12 months. She says she has not heard anything since. The BBC has asked Aldi for a comment.\n\nIn February we reported that more 16-24 year-olds were not in work, education or training at the end of 2024 than at any point in the past 11 years. That is 13.4%, or almost one out of every seven people in that age range, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Faisa was one of hundreds of people who commented on this report on BBC News TikTok saying their unemployment was not for want of trying. \"I check every day, there are no jobs,\" one user said. Another said: \"Finished my uni degree and can't find one job within the field I studied for.\" A third user posted: \"Young people aren't fussy we literally can't even get hired cleaning toilets.\"\n\nThe number of jobs on offer in the UK fell to 781,000 in the first three months of the year, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Some experts believe the rising cost of employing people is making businesses hold back on hiring new staff. In April the rate of employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) went up and so did minimum wages across different age groups. Business groups have also called for urgent changes to the forthcoming Employment Rights Bill over concerns it could hit hiring. Under the new law being scrutinised in the House of Lords on Tuesday, company bosses will be required to offer a zero-hours worker a guaranteed-hours contract based on the hours they clock up during a 12-week period. The biggest concern among retail HR directors is that this risks making it much harder to offer people part-time jobs, according to a BRC survey. It surveyed HR directors at 30 businesses, together employing 585,000 retail workers. Just over half said the law change would result in a reduction in staff numbers in their business, while 61% said the new law would reduce flexibility in job offerings.\n\nBRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: \"Almost 250,000 jobs have been lost in retail over the last five years and many major retailers have already announced further job cuts on the back of increased costs of employment which kicked in in April.\" She said part-time roles were down by 200,000 since 2017. \"These roles, which provide vital entry points into work for students, carers and returners, are set to be hardest hit,\" she said. \"In its current form the Employment Rights Bill could backfire, putting the brakes on hiring, or worse still, putting retail job numbers further into reverse.\"\n\nAmy Wilkes Amy says not hearing back about job applications can feel \"impossible\" but says you must not give up\n\nIn November we spoke to Amy Wilkes, 23, from Coventry who was struggling to find a job after getting a degree in criminology, policing and investigation. She says she applied for supermarket roles but did not get a response. \"It was feeling impossible,\" she says. \"What really hurt me was the not hearing back because you don't get any feedback to tell you where you're going wrong.\" After seven months Amy secured a job as a support worker, which she will start in July. \"It was a surreal moment when I found out. I was in absolute shock, quite emotional but very thrilled,\" she says. Her biggest piece of advice to others looking for work is \"don't give up\". \"I know it's really hard but there is a job out there for you,\" she says. \"Think about what you can offer - that helped my confidence to think about myself and knowing my value and what I could bring to a company.\"\n\nA government spokesperson said its new \"youth guarantee\" was \"providing every 18-21-year-old in England with access to an apprenticeship, quality training and education opportunities or help to find a job\". It said its decisions, including to raise employer NICs, were necessary to \"stabilise the public finances\" to fund services like the NHS. They added that business could claim employer NICs relief for some eligible staff including those aged under 21 and for apprentices under the age of 25.\n\nSix expert tips for finding work",

Over the Easter weekend, customers reported problems using contactless pay and Click & Collect, and online orders have been paused on the company's website and app since Friday. It is not clear how widespread the empty shelves are but the retailer confirmed \"pockets of limited availability in some stores\". The BBC understands stock on the shelves will be back to normal within a couple of days, although it will take until the end of the week before M&S's overall operations begin to get back to usual.\n\nThe firm is also managing disruption to a small proportion of products that it supplies to Ocado, which delivers M&S online orders and which is part-owned by M&S. Although issues with contactless pay, Click & Collect and gift cards have since been resolved, customers can still not place online orders. About a third of M&S's clothing and household goods sales in the UK are through its online platforms and were worth some £1.2bn, according to its latest financial results. Although its share price was up slightly on Tuesday morning, it has fallen 4.6% over the last five days - with a notable dip on Friday when the firm announced it was stopping online orders. The problems come during a busy retailing period, as customers prepare for the good weather and purchase outdoor garden equipment, barbecue items and party food. The aftershocks of the cyber attack will dent its profits, analysts have told the BBC, as many customers go elsewhere to shop instead.",

Dr Victoria McCloud, who stepped down from court last year, said the judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\". She said the court had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\". Two weeks ago, judges at the Supreme Court unanimously ruled a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.\n\nSince then, interim guidance says in places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, \"trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\". Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces\n\nSupreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman\n\nDr McCloud was one of at least two trans people who had wanted to present arguments to the Supreme Court about how its outcome would affect them. Courts have the discretion to consider arguments from outside \"interveners\" - but judges often reject such interventions if they conclude they are going to hear all the relevant arguments from others. The Supreme Court considered arguments on trans issues from the human rights campaign group Amnesty International, but not from exclusively trans activists. Dr McCloud, 55, came out as trans in her twenties and is one of about 8,000 people to have legally changed the sex on their birth certificate. She went on to be a High Court Master - judges who often manage complex, expensive cases - and was publicly promoted as a symbol of the modern judiciary's diversity. She stood down a year ago, saying she could not continue her judicial work amid an increasingly difficult public debate that had led to her being singled out for abuse and criticism. Following the Supreme Court ruling, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it had given \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance.

After the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK). Barrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers. A lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".\n\nPitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\". Documents filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.\n\nControversial associates\n\nPrince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles. The prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy. Mr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful. Mr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined £150,000 in 2022. In January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company. The National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing. Author Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"\n\nWho owns Pitch@Palace?\n\nPitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts: a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholders\n\nan international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company Both arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal. Nonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\". Earlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations. However, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name. Founded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family. But early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited. This company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it. Corporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman.\n\nGetty Images The Duke of York presents a Pitch@Palace event in 2015\n\nInvestigations into Barrowman's companies",

    "full_text": "Sycamore Gap accused kept trophy of tree, jury told\n\n37 minutes ago Share Save Duncan Leatherdale & Evie Lake BBC News, North East and Cumbria Share Save\n\nNick Lewis Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers deny criminal damage\n\nTwo men accused of chopping down the famous Sycamore Gap tree kept a wedge as a trophy in a felling that prosecutors described as a \"moronic mission\". The tree had stood for more than 100 years in a dip on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland before it was felled overnight on 27 September, 2023, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Daniel Michael Graham, 39, from Carlisle and Adam Carruthers, 32, from Wigton in Cumbria, each deny two counts of criminal damage relating to the tree and the Roman wall. Opening the case to jurors, prosecutor Richard Wright KC said the tree which was held in \"high affection\" by many was chopped down in just minutes and the accused \"loved\" the outrage caused.\n\nPA Media The Sycamore Gap tree was felled in September 2023\n\nThe tree, which was planted in the late 1800s, had become \"famous\" and been photographed and depicted in films and art works \"countless times\", Mr Wright said. The opening as it happened On the night of 27 September, Mr Carruthers and Mr Graham made a 40-minute drive in the latter's Range Rover from Cumbria to chop down the tree, the prosecutor said.\n\nAs one cut it down using a technique known as hinge and wedge, the other filmed the act of \"deliberate mindless criminal damage\" on Mr Graham's mobile phone, the court heard. In the two minute and 41 second-long grainy video shown to jurors, a silhouetted figure can be seen appearing to cut at the base of a large tree which then falls over with big crash. Mr Wright said the person filming the \"criminal\" act was just as responsible as the person \"wielding the chainsaw\". \"Though the tree had grown for over a hundred years, the act of irreparably damaging it was the work of a matter of minutes,\" Mr Wright said. It was a \"moronic mission\" that the pair appeared to be \"revelling in\", the prosecutor said.\n\nNational Trust The tree had been planted on Hadrian's Wall in the 1800s\n\nMobile phone data and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras showed them travelling towards and away from the remote site, with a wedge of wood believed to have been cut out of the tree photographed by the pair in the boot of Mr Graham's car, the court heard. The following morning, when news of the \"senseless\" attack broke sparking international outrage, the two accused shared multiple news and social media posts between themselves. In one message Mr Graham said \"here we go\", the court heard. In a comment on Facebook, a man wrote: \"Some weak people that walk this earth, disgusting behaviour.\"\n\nPA Media The tree took just minutes to fell, prosecutors say\n\nTwo minutes later Mr Graham sent his co-accused a voice note saying: \"Weak? Does he realise how heavy [stuff] is?\" Mr Carruthers responded saying he would like to see the commenter \"launch an operation like we did last night\", adding: \"I don't think he's got the minerals.\" Mr Wright said that message was the \"clearest confirmation in their own voices\" the two men were responsible for felling the tree. The prosecutor said messages the men exchanged in the aftermath showed they were \"loving\" and \"revelling in\" the public's response He said: \"This is excitement at the fact it's gone worldwide it's gone viral, it's being talked about all over the world. \"There is no sadness here or remorse.\"\n\n'Public revulsion'\n\nThe court heard the men had proven expertise to fell a large tree with a video of them doing so filmed just weeks before. Both also had chainsaws at their homes but it was not believed they were the tools used to fell the Sycamore Gap tree. Mr Wright said neither that chainsaw or the wedge of wood taken from the tree as a \"trophy\" had been found and had probably been \"hidden away\". Mr Wright said both men denied their involvement to police and would seek to blame each other, their once close friendship appearing to have unravelled \"perhaps as the public revulsion at their behaviour became clear to them\". Jurors had previously been warned to try the case purely on the evidence heard in court and set all emotion aside. The trial continues.\n\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram. Send your story ideas here.\n\nRelated internet links HM Courts and Tribunals Service",

Owen Lawrence, 38, was arrested and taken to hospital, where he died, following the attack on the popular Otley Run pub crawl in Headingley on Saturday. A Facebook post seen by the BBC and understood to have been created by Mr Lawrence detailed plans for the \"The Otley Run Massacre\" and listed \"students, nightclub goers\", \"neurotypicals\" and \"police\" among targets. The post described the planned violence as \"terrorism, revenge and misogynic rage\".\n\nTwo women, aged 19 and 31, were injured in the attack and taken to hospital. The younger woman underwent surgery for life-threatening injuries and remains in a stable condition in hospital. The other victim has been discharged. A crossbow and a firearm were recovered from the scene.\n\nYappApp Two weapons - a crossbow and a firearm - were recovered from the scene\n\nIn the online post, reference was made to a \"manifesto\" written by the man who killed 51 people during shootings at a mosque and Islamic centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. The post also contained reference to weapons, including a crossbow and airgun. Counter Terrorism Policing North East (CTPNE) said it was believed that Mr Lawrence, from Headingley, was acting on his own and it was not currently seeking anyone else. They said officers were continuing to \"conduct a thorough and extensive investigation to establish the facts and circumstances around the incident\". Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley, from CTPNE, said: \"We understand there are concerns around the incident, and questions about how and why this has happened. \"Our teams are committed to carrying out an in-depth investigation to provide answers to those affected.\"\n\nFacebook Mr Lawrence was arrested and taken to hospital after the attack on Saturday\n\nPolice were called to Otley Road just after 14:45 BST on Saturday after reports of a man seen with weapons. The Otley Run is an informal 19-stop drinking route spread over three miles along Otley Road and is popular with the thousands of students at the city's universities. West Yorkshire Police's Ch Supt Steve Dodds said: \"We fully appreciate the understandable shock and concern that this incident has caused in the Headingley community, and we are continuing to work closely alongside our partner agencies to support and reassure those living, working or studying in, or visiting the area.\" The attack prompted calls for better security around the route of the pub crawl. Headingley Labour councillor Jonathan Pryor, who is also deputy leader of Leeds City Council, said the authority was looking at ways to make it safer. \"It's not a formal event, it's just a pub crawl - but there is always a huge amount of people,\" he said. \"But there aren't the same security measures you would get at a football match or Leeds Carnival. That's something we need to look at.\"\n\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

The 24.5C recorded at St James's Park in London will likely be exceeded over the coming days, with the UK expected to see its warmest start to May on record. Temperatures are expected to peak on Thursday as voters head to the polls for local elections in England, with high UV and pollen levels also likely. The weather will gradually cool over the bank holiday weekend, although it will stay dry and sunny for most.\n\nTemperatures will widely be in the low to mid-twenties on Wednesday, with the hottest weather likely around the London area at 27C. The last time this temperature was recorded in April was in 2018 in Cambridge. On Thursday, it will get slightly cooler across Scotland and Northern Ireland, as temperatures drop to 13-16C. But in the south, the heat will continue to build and likely result in the UK's warmest start to May on record at 29C. This exceeds the previous 1 May record of 27.4C at Lossiemouth in 1990. With increasing humidity on Thursday, there is also a risk of some heavy and possibly thundery showers breaking out across England and Wales.\n\nTemperatures will gradually fall over the long weekend. However, it will stay dry in most areas, with lengthy sunny spells and light winds. Northern Scotland and eastern parts of the UK are expected to see the cloudiest weather, especially on Sunday. By Monday, temperatures will drop to between 12C and 17C across the UK - looking more like the average for early May.\n\nIs the UK experiencing a heatwave?\n\nIt is not likely that this spell of warm weather will qualify as a heatwave. This would need at least three consecutive days at or above the \"heatwave threshold,\" which varies depending on where you are in the UK. It is not unusual to see this type of hot spell in the spring, and April can bring big swings in temperature. But as our climate continues to warm, this type of spring heat is expected occur more often. Recent analysis found that spring is the fastest-warming season in the UK.",

    "full_text": "Trans former judge plans to challenge gender ruling at European court\n\n1 hour ago Share Save Dominic Casciani • @BBCDomC Home and Legal Correspondent Share Save\n\nAvalon Victoria McCloud, pictured in 2010 when she was sworn in as a Queen's Bench Master, stood down from High Court work last year\n\nThe UK's only ever judge to publicly say they are transgender is planning to take the government to the European Court of Human Rights over the Supreme Court's ground-breaking ruling on biological sex. Dr Victoria McCloud, who stepped down from court last year, said the judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\". She said the court had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\". Two weeks ago, judges at the Supreme Court unanimously ruled a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.\n\nIt was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" are defined in the legislation. He told the court: \"The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. \"But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.\" Since then, interim guidance says in places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, \"trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\". Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces\n\nSupreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman\n\nDr McCloud was one of at least two trans people who had wanted to present arguments to the Supreme Court about how its outcome would affect them. Courts have the discretion to consider arguments from outside \"interveners\" - but judges often reject such interventions if they conclude they are going to hear all the relevant arguments from others. The Supreme Court considered arguments on trans issues from the human rights campaign group Amnesty International, but not from exclusively trans activists. Dr McCloud, 55, came out as trans in her twenties and is one of about 8,000 people to have legally changed the sex on their birth certificate. She went on to be a High Court Master - judges who often manage complex, expensive cases - and was publicly promoted as a symbol of the modern judiciary's diversity. She stood down a year ago, saying she could not continue her judicial work amid an increasingly difficult public debate that had led to her being singled out for abuse and criticism. Following the Supreme Court ruling, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it had given \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance. But Dr McCloud said that far from clarifying the law, the court had not considered how such an outcome would impact the lives of trans people.\n\nDr Victoria McCloud speaking to the BBC over a video link on Monday\n\n\"Trans people were wholly excluded from this court case,\" said Dr McCloud. \"I applied to be heard. Two of us did. We were refused. \"[The court] heard no material going to the question of the proportionality and the impact on trans people. It didn't hear evidence from us. \"The Supreme Court failed in my view, adequately, to think about human rights points.\" Dr McCloud says she and other campaigners will go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to seek a declaration that the actions of the UK government and Supreme Court judgement \"violate [her] fundamental human rights\". \"Just as the prime minister didn't know what a woman was, actually the Supreme Court don't know because they haven't defined biological sex,\" said the former judge. \"The answer [in my view] is that a woman in law is someone with the letter F on her birth certificate.\" Dr McCloud has a Gender Recognition Certificate - which means her acquired female gender is recorded on her birth certificate. At the same time, the Supreme Court ruling means she is defined as a man for the purposes of the Equality Act. In its judgement, the court said biological sex refers to \"the sex of a person at birth\". It emphasises that only women can be pregnant, for example, and women have specific legal protection during pregnancy. Trans campaigners argue the court did not take into account their view of the complexities of biology. They argue it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary. However, gender-critical campaigners say biology comes down to a common-sense assessment of what makes a man or a woman.\n\nPA Media Campaigners from For Women Scotland celebrate the Supreme Court's judgement earlier this month\n\n\"[This judgement] has left me two sexes at once, which is a nonsense and ironic, because the Supreme Court said that sex was binary,\" said Dr McCloud. \"I am a woman for all purposes in law, but [now under this judgement] I'm a man for the Equality Act 2010. So I have to probably guess on any given occasion which sex I am.\" The equalities watchdog's interim guidance says trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities. It also means trans men - biological females who want to live as men - have to use women's spaces. The guidance states that \"in some circumstances the law also allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use the men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use the women's facilities\". For example, trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance\", the watchdog told the BBC. The guidance adds: \"Where facilities are available to both men and women, trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use.\"",

    "full_text": "Sycamore Gap accused kept trophy of tree, jury told\n\n55 minutes ago Share Save Duncan Leatherdale & Evie Lake BBC News, North East and Cumbria Share Save\n\nNick Lewis Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers deny criminal damage\n\nTwo men accused of chopping down the famous Sycamore Gap tree kept a wedge as a trophy in a felling that prosecutors described as a \"moronic mission\". The tree had stood for more than 100 years in a dip on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland before it was felled overnight on 27 September, 2023, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Daniel Michael Graham, 39, from Carlisle and Adam Carruthers, 32, from Wigton in Cumbria, each deny two counts of criminal damage relating to the tree and the Roman wall. Opening the case to jurors, prosecutor Richard Wright KC said the tree which was held in \"high affection\" by many was chopped down in just minutes and the accused \"loved\" the outrage caused.\n\nPA Media The Sycamore Gap tree was felled in September 2023\n\nThe tree, which was planted in the late 1800s, had become \"famous\" and been photographed and depicted in films and art works \"countless times\", Mr Wright said. The opening as it happened On the night of 27 September, Mr Carruthers and Mr Graham made a 40-minute drive in the latter's Range Rover from Cumbria to chop down the tree, the prosecutor said.\n\nAs one cut it down using a technique known as hinge and wedge, the other filmed the act of \"deliberate mindless criminal damage\" on Mr Graham's mobile phone, the court heard. In the two minute and 41 second-long grainy video shown to jurors, a silhouetted figure can be seen appearing to cut at the base of a large tree which then falls over with big crash. Mr Wright said the person filming the \"criminal\" act was just as responsible as the person \"wielding the chainsaw\". \"Though the tree had grown for over a hundred years, the act of irreparably damaging it was the work of a matter of minutes,\" Mr Wright said. It was a \"moronic mission\" that the pair appeared to be \"revelling in\", the prosecutor said.\n\nNational Trust The tree had been planted on Hadrian's Wall in the 1800s\n\nMobile phone data and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras showed them travelling towards and away from the remote site, with a wedge of wood believed to have been cut out of the tree photographed by the pair in the boot of Mr Graham's car, the court heard. The following morning, when news of the \"senseless\" attack broke sparking international outrage, the two accused shared multiple news and social media posts between themselves. In one message Mr Graham said \"here we go\", the court heard. In a comment on Facebook, a man wrote: \"Some weak people that walk this earth, disgusting behaviour.\"\n\nPA Media The tree took just minutes to fell, prosecutors say\n\nTwo minutes later Mr Graham sent his co-accused a voice note saying: \"Weak? Does he realise how heavy [stuff] is?\" Mr Carruthers responded saying he would like to see the commenter \"launch an operation like we did last night\", adding: \"I don't think he's got the minerals.\" Mr Wright said that message was the \"clearest confirmation in their own voices\" the two men were responsible for felling the tree. The prosecutor said messages the men exchanged in the aftermath showed they were \"loving\" and \"revelling in\" the public's response. He said: \"This is excitement at the fact it's gone worldwide it's gone viral, it's being talked about all over the world. \"There is no sadness here or remorse.\"\n\n'Public revulsion'\n\nThe court heard the men had proven expertise to fell a large tree with a video of them doing so filmed just weeks before. Both also had chainsaws at their homes but it was not believed they were the tools used to fell the Sycamore Gap tree. Mr Wright said neither that chainsaw or the wedge of wood taken from the tree as a \"trophy\" had been found and had probably been \"hidden away\". Mr Wright said both men denied their involvement to police and would seek to blame each other, their once close friendship appearing to have unravelled \"perhaps as the public revulsion at their behaviour became clear to them\". Jurors had previously been warned to try the case purely on the evidence heard in court and set all emotion aside. The trial continues.\n\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram. Send your story ideas here.\n\nRelated internet links HM Courts and Tribunals Service"

    "full_text": "Crossbow attack suspect put 'massacre' plans online\n\n44 minutes ago Share Save Alex Moss BBC News, Yorkshire Share Save\n\nFacebook Owen Lawrence posted on Facebook about his plans to carry out a \"massacre\"\n\nThe suspect in the Leeds crossbow attack, who police announced earlier had died of a self-inflicted wound, wrote a hate-filled online manifesto hours before the assault. Owen Lawrence, 38, was arrested and taken to hospital, where he died, following the attack on the popular Otley Run pub crawl in Headingley on Saturday. A Facebook post seen by the BBC and understood to have been created by Mr Lawrence detailed plans for the \"The Otley Run Massacre\" and listed \"students, nightclub goers\", \"neurotypicals\" and \"police\" among targets. The post described the planned violence as \"terrorism, revenge and misogynic rage\".\n\nTwo women, aged 19 and 31, were injured in the attack and taken to hospital. The younger woman underwent surgery for life-threatening injuries and remains in a stable condition in hospital. The other victim has been discharged. A crossbow and a firearm were recovered from the scene.\n\nYappApp Two weapons - a crossbow and a firearm - were recovered from the scene\n\nIn the online post, reference was made to a \"manifesto\" written by the man who killed 51 people during shootings at a mosque and Islamic centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. The post contained reference to weapons, including a crossbow and airgun, and it stated he had \"explored far right ideas\". In a separate post, also apparently made by Mr Lawrence earlier this year, he listed that he hated \"gender equality\" , \"soap operas\", \"feminists of all four waves\" and \"feminoids\", as well as \"soap operas\" and \"society\". Counter Terrorism Policing North East (CTPNE) said it was believed that Mr Lawrence, from Headingley, was acting on his own and it was not currently seeking anyone else. They said officers were continuing to \"conduct a thorough and extensive investigation to establish the facts and circumstances around the incident\". Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley, from CTPNE, said: \"We understand there are concerns around the incident, and questions about how and why this has happened. \"Our teams are committed to carrying out an in-depth investigation to provide answers to those affected.\"\n\nFacebook Mr Lawrence was arrested and taken to hospital after the attack on Saturday\n\nPolice were called to Otley Road just after 14:45 BST on Saturday after reports of a man seen with weapons. The Otley Run is an informal 19-stop drinking route spread over three miles along Otley Road and is popular with the thousands of students at the city's universities. West Yorkshire Police's Ch Supt Steve Dodds said: \"We fully appreciate the understandable shock and concern that this incident has caused in the Headingley community, and we are continuing to work closely alongside our partner agencies to support and reassure those living, working or studying in, or visiting the area.\" The attack prompted calls for better security around the route of the pub crawl. Headingley Labour councillor Jonathan Pryor, who is also deputy leader of Leeds City Council, said the authority was looking at ways to make it safer. \"It's not a formal event, it's just a pub crawl - but there is always a huge amount of people,\" he said. \"But there aren't the same security measures you would get at a football match or Leeds Carnival. That's something we need to look at.\"\n\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North."

The 24.5C recorded at St James's Park in London will likely be exceeded over the coming days, with the UK expected to see its warmest start to May on record. Temperatures are expected to peak on Thursday as voters head to the polls for local elections in England, with high UV and pollen levels also likely. The weather will gradually cool over the bank holiday weekend, although it will stay dry and sunny for most.\n\nTemperatures will widely be in the low to mid-twenties on Wednesday, with the hottest weather likely around the London area at 27C. The last time this temperature was recorded in April was in 2018 in Cambridge. On Thursday, it will get slightly cooler across Scotland and Northern Ireland, as temperatures drop to 13-16C. But in the south, the heat will continue to build and likely result in the UK's warmest start to May on record at 29C. This exceeds the previous 1 May record of 27.4C at Lossiemouth in 1990. With increasing humidity on Thursday, there is also a risk of some heavy and possibly thundery showers breaking out across England and Wales.\n\nTemperatures will gradually fall over the long weekend. However, it will stay dry in most areas, with lengthy sunny spells and light winds. Northern Scotland and eastern parts of the UK are expected to see the cloudiest weather, especially on Sunday. By Monday, temperatures will drop to between 12C and 17C across the UK - looking more like the average for early May.\n\nIs the UK experiencing a heatwave?\n\nIt is not likely that this spell of warm weather will qualify as a heatwave. This would need at least three consecutive days at or above the \"heatwave threshold,\" which varies depending on where you are in the UK. It is not unusual to see this type of hot spell in the spring, and April can bring big swings in temperature. But as our climate continues to warm, this type of spring heat is expected occur more often. Recent analysis found that spring is the fastest-warming season in the UK."

    "full_text": "Trans former judge plans to challenge gender ruling at European court\n\n1 hour ago Share Save Dominic Casciani • @BBCDomC Home and Legal Correspondent Share Save\n\nAvalon Victoria McCloud, pictured in 2010 when she was sworn in as a Queen's Bench Master, stood down from High Court work last year\n\nThe UK's only ever judge to publicly say they are transgender is planning to take the government to the European Court of Human Rights over the Supreme Court's ground-breaking ruling on biological sex. Dr Victoria McCloud, who stepped down from court last year, said the judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\". She said the court had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\". Two weeks ago, judges at the Supreme Court unanimously ruled a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.\n\nIt was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" are defined in the legislation. He told the court: \"The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. \"But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.\" Since then, interim guidance says in places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, \"trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\". Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces\n\nSupreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman\n\nDr McCloud was one of at least two trans people who had wanted to present arguments to the Supreme Court about how its outcome would affect them. Courts have the discretion to consider arguments from outside \"interveners\" - but judges often reject such interventions if they conclude they are going to hear all the relevant arguments from others. The Supreme Court considered arguments on trans issues from the human rights campaign group Amnesty International, but not from exclusively trans activists. Dr McCloud, 55, came out as trans in her twenties and is one of about 8,000 people to have legally changed the sex on their birth certificate. She went on to be a High Court Master - judges who often manage complex, expensive cases - and was publicly promoted as a symbol of the modern judiciary's diversity. She stood down a year ago, saying she could not continue her judicial work amid an increasingly difficult public debate that had led to her being singled out for abuse and criticism. Following the Supreme Court ruling, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it had given \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance. But Dr McCloud said that far from clarifying the law, the court had not considered how such an outcome would impact the lives of trans people.\n\nDr Victoria McCloud speaking to the BBC over a video link on Monday\n\n\"Trans people were wholly excluded from this court case,\" said Dr McCloud. \"I applied to be heard. Two of us did. We were refused. \"[The court] heard no material going to the question of the proportionality and the impact on trans people. It didn't hear evidence from us. \"The Supreme Court failed in my view, adequately, to think about human rights points.\" Dr McCloud says she and other campaigners will go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to seek a declaration that the actions of the UK government and Supreme Court judgement \"violate [her] fundamental human rights\". \"Just as the prime minister didn't know what a woman was, actually the Supreme Court don't know because they haven't defined biological sex,\" said the former judge. \"The answer [in my view] is that a woman in law is someone with the letter F on her birth certificate.\" Dr McCloud has a Gender Recognition Certificate - which means her acquired female gender is recorded on her birth certificate. At the same time, the Supreme Court ruling means she is defined as a man for the purposes of the Equality Act. In its judgement, the court said biological sex refers to \"the sex of a person at birth\". It emphasises that only women can be pregnant, for example, and women have specific legal protection during pregnancy. Trans campaigners argue the court did not take into account their view of the complexities of biology. They argue it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary. However, gender-critical campaigners say biology comes down to a common-sense assessment of what makes a man or a woman.\n\nPA Media Campaigners from For Women Scotland celebrate the Supreme Court's judgement earlier this month\n\n\"[This judgement] has left me two sexes at once, which is a nonsense and ironic, because the Supreme Court said that sex was binary,\" said Dr McCloud. \"I am a woman for all purposes in law, but [now under this judgement] I'm a man for the Equality Act 2010. So I have to probably guess on any given occasion which sex I am.\" The equalities watchdog's interim guidance says trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities. It also means trans men - biological females who want to live as men - have to use women's spaces. The guidance states that \"in some circumstances the law also allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use the men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use the women's facilities\". For example, trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance\", the watchdog told the BBC. The guidance adds: \"Where facilities are available to both men and women, trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use.\""

In the two minute and 41 second-long grainy video shown to jurors, a silhouetted figure can be seen appearing to cut at the base of a large tree which then falls over with big crash. Mr Wright said the person filming the \"criminal\" act was just as responsible as the person \"wielding the chainsaw\". \"Though the tree had grown for over a hundred years, the act of irreparably damaging it was the work of a matter of minutes,\" Mr Wright said. It was a \"moronic mission\" that the pair appeared to be \"revelling in\", the prosecutor said.\n\nNational Trust The tree had been planted on Hadrian's Wall in the 1800s\n\nMobile phone data and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras showed them travelling towards and away from the remote site, with a wedge of wood believed to have been cut out of the tree photographed by the pair in the boot of Mr Graham's car, the court heard. The following morning, when news of the \"senseless\" attack broke sparking international outrage, the two accused shared multiple news and social media posts between themselves. In one message Mr Graham said \"here we go\", the court heard. In a comment on Facebook, a man wrote: \"Some weak people that walk this earth, disgusting behaviour.\"\n\nPA Media The tree took just minutes to fell, prosecutors say\n\nTwo minutes later Mr Graham sent his co-accused a voice note saying: \"Weak? Does he realise how heavy [stuff] is?\" Mr Carruthers responded saying he would like to see the commenter \"launch an operation like we did last night\", adding: \"I don't think he's got the minerals.\" Mr Wright said that message was the \"clearest confirmation in their own voices\" the two men were responsible for felling the tree. The prosecutor said messages the men exchanged in the aftermath showed they were \"loving\" and \"revelling in\" the public's response. He said: \"This is excitement at the fact it's gone worldwide it's gone viral, it's being talked about all over the world. \"There is no sadness here or remorse.\"\n\n'Public revulsion'\n\nThe court heard the men had proven expertise to fell a large tree with a video of them doing so filmed just weeks before. Both also had chainsaws at their homes but it was not believed they were the tools used to fell the Sycamore Gap tree. Mr Wright said neither that chainsaw or the wedge of wood taken from the tree as a \"trophy\" had been found and had probably been \"hidden away\". Mr Wright said both men denied their involvement to police and would seek to blame each other, their once close friendship appearing to have unravelled \"perhaps as the public revulsion at their behaviour became clear to them\". Jurors had previously been warned to try the case purely on the evidence heard in court and set all emotion aside. The trial continues.\n\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram. Send your story ideas here.\n\nRelated internet links HM Courts and Tribunals Service"

    "full_text": "Crossbow attack suspect put 'massacre' plans online\n\n44 minutes ago Share Save Alex Moss BBC News, Yorkshire Share Save\n\nFacebook Owen Lawrence posted on Facebook about his plans to carry out a \"massacre\"\n\nThe suspect in the Leeds crossbow attack, who police announced earlier had died of a self-inflicted wound, wrote a hate-filled online manifesto hours before the assault. Owen Lawrence, 38, was arrested and taken to hospital, where he died, following the attack on the popular Otley Run pub crawl in Headingley on Saturday. A Facebook post seen by the BBC and understood to have been created by Mr Lawrence detailed plans for the \"The Otley Run Massacre\" and listed \"students, nightclub goers\", \"neurotypicals\" and \"police\" among targets. The post described the planned violence as \"terrorism, revenge and misogynic rage\".\n\nTwo women, aged 19 and 31, were injured in the attack and taken to hospital. The younger woman underwent surgery for life-threatening injuries and remains in a stable condition in hospital. The other victim has been discharged. A crossbow and a firearm were recovered from the scene.\n\nYappApp Two weapons - a crossbow and a firearm - were recovered from the scene\n\nIn the online post, reference was made to a \"manifesto\" written by the man who killed 51 people during shootings at a mosque and Islamic centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. The post contained reference to weapons, including a crossbow and airgun, and it stated he had \"explored far right ideas\". In a separate post, also apparently made by Mr Lawrence earlier this year, he listed that he hated \"gender equality\" , \"soap operas\", \"feminists of all four waves\" and \"feminoids\", as well as \"soap operas\" and \"society\". Counter Terrorism Policing North East (CTPNE) said it was believed that Mr Lawrence, from Headingley, was acting on his own and it was not currently seeking anyone else. They said officers were continuing to \"conduct a thorough and extensive investigation to establish the facts and circumstances around the incident\". Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley, from CTPNE, said: \"We understand there are concerns around the incident, and questions about how and why this has happened. \"Our teams are committed to carrying out an in-depth investigation to provide answers to those affected.\"\n\nFacebook Mr Lawrence was arrested and taken to hospital after the attack on Saturday\n\nPolice were called to Otley Road just after 14:45 BST on Saturday after reports of a man seen with weapons. The Otley Run is an informal 19-stop drinking route spread over three miles along Otley Road and is popular with the thousands of students at the city's universities. West Yorkshire Police's Ch Supt Steve Dodds said: \"We fully appreciate the understandable shock and concern that this incident has caused in the Headingley community, and we are continuing to work closely alongside our partner agencies to support and reassure those living, working or studying in, or visiting the area.\" The attack prompted calls for better security around the route of the pub crawl. Headingley Labour councillor Jonathan Pryor, who is also deputy leader of Leeds City Council, said the authority was looking at ways to make it safer. \"It's not a formal event, it's just a pub crawl - but there is always a huge amount of people,\" he said. \"But there aren't the same security measures you would get at a football match or Leeds Carnival. That's something we need to look at.\"\n\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North."

The 24.5C recorded at St James's Park in London will likely be exceeded over the coming days, with the UK expected to see its warmest start to May on record. Temperatures are expected to peak on Thursday as voters head to the polls for local elections in England, with high UV and pollen levels also likely. The weather will gradually cool over the bank holiday weekend, although it will stay dry and sunny for most.\n\nTemperatures will widely be in the low to mid-twenties on Wednesday, with the hottest weather likely around the London area at 27C. The last time this temperature was recorded in April was in 2018 in Cambridge. On Thursday, it will get slightly cooler across Scotland and Northern Ireland, as temperatures drop to 13-16C. But in the south, the heat will continue to build and likely result in the UK's warmest start to May on record at 29C. This exceeds the previous 1 May record of 27.4C at Lossiemouth in 1990. With increasing humidity on Thursday, there is also a risk of some heavy and possibly thundery showers breaking out across England and Wales.\n\nTemperatures will gradually fall over the long weekend. However, it will stay dry in most areas, with lengthy sunny spells and light winds. Northern Scotland and eastern parts of the UK are expected to see the cloudiest weather, especially on Sunday. By Monday, temperatures will drop to between 12C and 17C across the UK - looking more like the average for early May.\n\nIs the UK experiencing a heatwave?\n\nIt is not likely that this spell of warm weather will qualify as a heatwave. This would need at least three consecutive days at or above the \"heatwave threshold,\" which varies depending on where you are in the UK. It is not unusual to see this type of hot spell in the spring, and April can bring big swings in temperature. But as our climate continues to warm, this type of spring heat is expected occur more often. Recent analysis found that spring is the fastest-warming season in the UK."

    "full_text": "Trans former judge plans to challenge gender ruling at European court\n\n1 hour ago Share Save Dominic Casciani • @BBCDomC Home and Legal Correspondent Share Save\n\nAvalon Victoria McCloud, pictured in 2010 when she was sworn in as a Queen's Bench Master, stood down from High Court work last year\n\nThe UK's only ever judge to publicly say they are transgender is planning to take the government to the European Court of Human Rights over the Supreme Court's ground-breaking ruling on biological sex. Dr Victoria McCloud, who stepped down from court last year, said the judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\". She said the court had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\". Two weeks ago, judges at the Supreme Court unanimously ruled a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.\n\nIt was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" are defined in the legislation. He told the court: \"The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. \"But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.\" Since then, interim guidance says in places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, \"trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\". Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces\n\nSupreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman\n\nDr McCloud was one of at least two trans people who had wanted to present arguments to the Supreme Court about how its outcome would affect them. Courts have the discretion to consider arguments from outside \"interveners\" - but judges often reject such interventions if they conclude they are going to hear all the relevant arguments from others. The Supreme Court considered arguments on trans issues from the human rights campaign group Amnesty International, but not from exclusively trans activists. Dr McCloud, 55, came out as trans in her twenties and is one of about 8,000 people to have legally changed the sex on their birth certificate. She went on to be a High Court Master - judges who often manage complex, expensive cases - and was publicly promoted as a symbol of the modern judiciary's diversity. She stood down a year ago, saying she could not continue her judicial work amid an increasingly difficult public debate that had led to her being singled out for abuse and criticism. Following the Supreme Court ruling, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it had given \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance. But Dr McCloud said that far from clarifying the law, the court had not considered how such an outcome would impact the lives of trans people.\n\nDr Victoria McCloud speaking to the BBC over a video link on Monday\n\n\"Trans people were wholly excluded from this court case,\" said Dr McCloud. \"I applied to be heard. Two of us did. We were refused. \"[The court] heard no material going to the question of the proportionality and the impact on trans people. It didn't hear evidence from us. \"The Supreme Court failed in my view, adequately, to think about human rights points.\" Dr McCloud says she and other campaigners will go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to seek a declaration that the actions of the UK government and Supreme Court judgement \"violate [her] fundamental human rights\". \"Just as the prime minister didn't know what a woman was, actually the Supreme Court don't know because they haven't defined biological sex,\" said the former judge. \"The answer [in my view] is that a woman in law is someone with the letter F on her birth certificate.\" Dr McCloud has a Gender Recognition Certificate - which means her acquired female gender is recorded on her birth certificate. At the same time, the Supreme Court ruling means she is defined as a man for the purposes of the Equality Act. In its judgement, the court said biological sex refers to \"the sex of a person at birth\". It emphasises that only women can be pregnant, for example, and women have specific legal protection during pregnancy. Trans campaigners argue the court did not take into account their view of the complexities of biology. They argue it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary. However, gender-critical campaigners say biology comes down to a common-sense assessment of what makes a man or a woman.\n\nPA Media Campaigners from For Women Scotland celebrate the Supreme Court's judgement earlier this month\n\n\"[This judgement] has left me two sexes at once, which is a nonsense and ironic, because the Supreme Court said that sex was binary,\" said Dr McCloud. \"I am a woman for all purposes in law, but [now under this judgement] I'm a man for the Equality Act 2010. So I have to probably guess on any given occasion which sex I am.\" The equalities watchdog's interim guidance says trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities. It also means trans men - biological females who want to live as men - have to use women's spaces. The guidance states that \"in some circumstances the law also allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use the men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use the women's facilities\". For example, trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance\", the watchdog told the BBC. The guidance adds: \"Where facilities are available to both men and women, trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use.\""
