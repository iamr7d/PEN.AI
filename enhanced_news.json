A single white rose was pictured lying on the stone tomb that bears the name he was known by during his pontificate, below a crucifix illuminated by a single spotlight. The late pope was laid to rest at the church - one of four major basilicas in the Italian capital, and one he would regularly visit during his time as cardinal and pontiff - in a private ceremony following his public funeral in the Vatican on Saturday. Thousands of mourners have been filing past the tomb since the church opened to the public on Sunday morning to pay their respects to Pope Francis, who died aged 88 on Monday.\n\nGetty Images A single white rose was pictured lying on the stone tomb bearing Pope Francis's name\n\nAmong them was Rosario Correale, an Italian, who said it was \"very emotional\" seeing the tomb. \"He really left a mark on us,\" he told the Associated Press. Polish pilgrim Maria Brzezinska felt the resting place befit the man. \"I feel like it's exactly in the way of the Pope. He was simple, and so is his place now,\" she told the news agency Reuters after visiting. Francis was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary, and Santa Maria Maggiore was the first church to be dedicated to her when it was built in the 4th Century. The basilica sits near the Colosseum, a stone's throw from the city's endlessly bustling and chaotic central Termini station - well beyond the limits of the Vatican, where popes are traditionally entombed. But it was one the South American pontiff had a long-held affinity for. It's senior priest previously told an Italian newspaper that Pope Francis had said he wished to be laid to rest there in 2022, citing inspiration from the Virgin Mary. \"I thought it was amazing that he wanted to be buried here in this basilica,\" Amaya Morris, another pilgrim, told AP. \"Out of all of the [churches], he chose this one. So I thought that was really amazing. It's really humbling to be able to be here.\" Francis's funeral was attended by heads of state, heads of government and monarchs from around the world - as well as hundreds of thousands of Catholics who lined the streets leading to the Vatican to pay their respects. Hymns played out on giant speakers, occasionally drowned out by the sound of helicopters flying overhead, before 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re gave a homily on the pope's legacy. The cardinal emphasised that Pope Francis had repeatedly urged the world to \"build bridges, not walls\".\n\nReuters Mourners queued outside the church early on Sunday morning to be among the first to pay their respects",

    "full_text": "Greens call for single-sex guidance to be withdrawn\n\n40 minutes ago Share Save Becky Morton Political reporter Share Save\n\nCarla Denyer calls for EHRC to withdraw trans guidance\n\nInterim guidance on single-sex spaces is \"ill-considered and impractical\" and should be withdrawn, the Green Party has said. The guidance, issued by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), followed the UK Supreme Court's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act. In places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use women's facilities but they should not be left with no facilities to use, the guidance says. Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer told the BBC the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination, while Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said there were questions over how it would be enforced.\n\nCabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said the \"logical consequence\" of the Supreme Court ruling and EHRC guidance was that \"people use the facilities of their biological sex\". Asked if the government would ban trans people from using changing rooms or toilets they wish to use in its own buildings, he told the BBC: \"In reality, when you say ban, am I going to be standing outside toilets? I'm probably not. \"There isn't going to be toilet police but that is the logical consequence of the court ruling and the EHRC guidance.\" The UK government has welcomed the Supreme Court ruling, saying it brings \"clarity\" for women and service providers. A spokesperson added: \"We will review and update policy wherever necessary to ensure it complies with the latest legal requirements.\" Last week the Supreme Court found the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\". This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces. As part of the judgement in the case brought against Scottish ministers by the group For Women Scotland, Supreme Court judge Lord Hodge stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.\n\nCarla Denyer, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said the interim guidance, which was published on Friday following the Supreme Court ruling on 15 April, was \"rushed and ill-thought out\". \"It's been really obvious that they have not listened to trans people,\" she told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. She added that the guidance put trans people at risk of discrimination, especially in workplaces, and \"seems to fly in face of the strong tradition of tolerance we have in Britain\". The Green Party said in a statement that the guidance was likely to cause \"distress\" to the trans community as well as \"further confusion to employers, businesses and service providers\" . It is calling for the guidance to be withdrawn \"until the EHRC can produce something more thought-through which takes into account the voices of all those affected\". Denyer questioned what should happen if trans people are not allowed to go to the toilet of their gender or their birth sex. The guidance also states that in some circumstances the law allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use women's facilities. When asked to clarify this, the EHRC pointed to a section of the Supreme Court ruling stating that trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken\" in the context of a women-only service. However, the guidance says where possible mixed-sex toilets or changing facilities should be provided, with lockable rooms intended to be used by one person at a time, in addition to single-sex facilities. Denyer also raised concerns that for lesbian associations or venues which wanted to include trans women, the advice appeared to say they would not be allowed to. The guidance states that \"a women-only or lesbian-only association should not admit trans women (biological men)\", while \"a men-only or gay men-only associations should not admit trans men (biological women)\".\n\nDavey calls for more guidance over trans judgement\n\nSir Ed also told the programme lots of people were confused and anxious about the guidance, for example over which toilet a trans man (biological woman) should use. The Lib Dem leader said his party accepted the Supreme Court ruling but there needed to be more debate in Parliament to reach a clear solution that \"respects people's rights\". The EHRC, which enforces equalities law and provides guidance to policymakers, public sector bodies and businesses, is expected to launch a two-week consultation to seek views from those affected in May. The watchdog is then aiming to provide an updated code of practice to the government for ministerial approval by the end of June. A spokesperson for the EHRC said: \"The law is as set out in the Supreme Court's very readable judgment and is effective immediately. \"Employers, service providers and others with duties under the Equality Act must follow the law and should take appropriate specialist legal advice where necessary. \"But we know many people have questions about the consequences of the judgment and what it means for them, which is why we issued this [guidance] in the interim.\" The spokesperson added: \"We remain committed to promoting equality and tackling discrimination in all its forms.\"",

    "full_text": "Ginger Mr Darcy will break barriers, jokes Lowden\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Thomas Mackintosh BBC News, London Share Save\n\nActor Jack Lowden has said he likes the idea of \"breaking down barriers\" by being a ginger Mr Darcy in a new adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The 34-year-old joked on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that \"it is one of the great last barriers to break down\". In a wide-ranging interview alongside fellow British actor Martin Freeman, 53, he discussed being trained by an ex-MI6 officer and their upcoming West End play. On his role in Netflix's six-part adaptation of Austen's classic novel, Lowden said he might draw on inspiration from some actors who have previously played the iconic Mr Darcy role.\n\n\"I quite like the idea of being a ginger Darcy,\" he told the BBC. \"I think that is really breaking down barriers - one of the great last barriers to be broken down.\" Sitting next to Lowden a smiling Freeman said he \"agreed\". Lowden continued: \"I quite like the idea of me coming along and doing something else with it. \"Or just copying one of them because some of the guys who played it are amongst the best. Matthew Macfadyen, to me, is one of the best actors on the planet. So if I just try copy him - maybe that's alright?\" \"But ginger?\" Freeman asked. \"Ginger\", Lowden replied. \"Yep, change it up.\"\n\nGetty Images Lowden is the husband of actress Saoirse Ronan and will be the latest actor to portray Mr Darcy\n\nLowden and Freeman are set to take part in the David Ireland's West End theatre show the Fifth Step which is due to open at Soho Place Theatre on 12 May. The pair told the programme they had not met before they agreed to play an alcoholic and his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor. Lowden said he enjoyed the dark humour of the show, saying that, while it may be \"corny\", laughter was \"the best medicine\" and a way of \"self-healing\".\n\nGetty Images Martin Freeman is known for a range of roles including in the Office and the Hobbit films\n\nAsked about the Bafta-nominated series Slow Horses, which focuses on intelligence agents who have been discarded by MI5, Lowden talked about being trained in spycraft. \"We did a day with an ex-MI6 officer who was helping us to train in the art of surveillance and counter-surveillance. Walking along and following a mark. \"He gave us a lecture for a bit and then said 'right we are going to go outside and do this'. But then he pulled the shutters up on the window and saw that it was raining and he went 'oh no maybe we shouldn't'. \"So MI6 don't operate a lot in the rain,\" Lowden - who has been touted as a possibility for the new James Bond - said. \"Maybe it's cause they're abroad a lot.\"",

The performer, who found fame on the fourth season of RuPaul's Drag Race, had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after suffering a \"severe infection\". Caliente had served as a judge on the show's Philippines spin-off, and also appeared in the hit US TV series Pose. Her family wrote in a statement on Instagram: \"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the passing of Bianca Castro-Arabejo, known to the world and cherished by many as Jiggly Caliente.\" They said she died in the early hours of Sunday morning \"surrounded by her loving family and close friends\".\n\nCaliente's family paid tribute to her \"infectious energy, fierce wit, and unwavering authenticity\", adding that she left a legacy of \"love, courage and light\". \"She touched countless lives through her artistry, activism, and the genuine connection she fostered with fans around the world,\" they said. \"Though her physical presence is gone, the joy she shared and the space she helped create for so many will remain forever.\"\n\nFellow drag queens have left tributes to the Filipino-American performer online. Laganja Estranja, who appeared on the sixth season of the US reality TV programme, said Caliente was a \"kind, caring soul\". RuPaul's Drag Race UK star Baga Chipz described Caliente as \"one of the kindest, sweetest souls I've ever met\". Cheryl The Queen, who also competed in the UK version of the show, wrote: \"We will love you forever and always Jiggly.\" Tia Kofi, who won Drag Race UK versus the World, said Caliente was \"someone I came to for advice, I looked up to, who gave me support when it was most needed and, I cannot lie, was always there for a good gossip!\"\n\nGetty Images Caliente (pictured) died early on Sunday morning \"surrounded by her loving family and close friends\"\n\nBorn in the Philippines in 1980, Caliente moved to the Queens neighbourhood of New York City with her family when she was a child. She quickly became a fan favourite on RuPaul's Drag Race for her sense of humour and memorable interactions with other queens, when she appeared on the show in 2012. In one particularly memorable moment, while arguing with Caliente, fellow contestant Lashauwn Beyond coined the catchphrase \"this is not RuPaul's Best Friend Race\", which has been frequently repeated in later series. Caliente went on to embark on an acting career, appearing in episodes of sitcoms Broad City and Search Party. She played the role of Veronica in the TV drama Pose, which chronicled New York's LGBT ball culture in the 1980s and 90s. Caliente, who publicly came out as transgender in 2016, later returned to the Drag Race universe, competing in the sixth series of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2021 and judging the spin-off show Drag Race Philippines for three series.",

Counter-terrorism police are investigating the incident, which happened on Otley Road, in the Headingley area, at about 14:47 BST yesterday. Three people were found injured and taken to hospital - including the suspected attacker - on the popular Otley Run pub crawl route. A 38-year-old man who suffered a \"self-inflicted injury\" was arrested and two weapons - a crossbow and a firearm - were recovered from the scene.\n\nHeadingley resident Vasileios Balampanos described seeing the aftermath of what had happened on Saturday. \"When I arrived, I drove down St Anne's Road and there were cordons and quite a few police cars,\" he said. \"I walked further down to have a look and there were a couple of ambulances.\"\n\nBBC/ Trudy Scanlon Vasileios Balampanos says the area is usually quiet, apart from students doing the Otley Run\n\nHe said he saw somebody being treated by paramedics further up Otley Road and said he saw \"a couple of distressed individuals, students mostly, talking about somebody being hurt\". Mr Balampanos added the ambulance then left the scene with blue lights on and the area was cordoned off. \"It was quite scary,\" he said. \"Generally, this is a quiet area but we have plenty of people doing the Otley Run and going to the pub. It can get busy sometimes.\"\n\nYappApp Two weapons were recovered from the scene, which were a crossbow and a firearm, police say\n\nHeadingley councillor Abdul Hannan said his thoughts were with the victims and said the council was working closely with the police and reassuring the community. \"It's horrific,\" he said. \"There is a lot of footfall in that area, it is a busy stretch, especially on a Saturday. \"It is a tragedy what has taken place.\" The Church of England has also issued a response to the attack, thanking emergency services and people who stayed at the scene to support victims. The Right Reverend Arun Arora, the Bishop of Kirkstall, who oversees the City of Leeds for the Church of England, said: \"There is an understandable sense of shock and numbness for people hearing news of Saturday's events. \"Prayers were offered in church services this morning close to where the attack occurred and space was made in chapels for silent prayer following the services. \"We will continue to pray for those who were injured in the attack and those who witnessed it.\"\n\nBBC/ Cathy Killick Cordons remain in place in the Headingley area of Leeds while inquiries continue\n\nDet Ch Supt James Dunkerley said on Saturday there was no evidence to suggest anyone else was involved in the attack and they \"were not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident\". A Counter Terrorism Policing North East spokesperson added extensive inquiries were continuing to establish \"the full circumstances and explore any potential motivation\". West Yorkshire's Assistant Chief Constable Carl Galvin also said on Saturday: \"Clearly this has been a shocking incident and we fully realise the concern it has caused. \"Due to the enquiry being active we are limited in what we can say, but I do want to reassure residents that everything possible is being done to investigate and understand what took place.\"\n\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.\n\nMore on this story Two women injured in attack involving crossbow",
