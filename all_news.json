The incident, which took place at the annual Lapu Lapu festival celebrating Filipino culture, also left dozens of people injured. A 30-year-old male suspect has been identified as Kai-Ji Adam Lo. He is in custody and faces several murder charges.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe attack took place at approximately 20:14 local time on Saturday (03:14 GMT on Sunday) at an event marking Lapu Lapu Day, which is celebrated every year on 27 April. Police later said that tens of thousands of people had been in attendance. Follow live updates here Festival-goers said a single vehicle was involved in the attack, which took place on East 43rd Avenue and Fraser in the south of Vancouver. \"There's a car that went just through the whole street and just hitting everyone,\" eyewitness Abigail Andiso told the Associated Press. \"I saw one dead, one man on the ground, and I went... towards the end where the car went, then there are more casualties, and you can see straight away there are about... maybe 20 people down, and everyone is panicking, everyone is screaming.\" James Cruzat, another eyewitness, told AP: \"It was heartbreaking. I couldn't even imagine that it's actually happening in real life, because normally we see that [on] TV or [in] movies. It was really shocking.\" Other witnesses reported that some of the pedestrians who were struck were close to where food trucks were parked. The driver of the vehicle was apprehended by bystanders and taken into custody by police officers.\n\nWhat is the Lapu Lapu festival?\n\nThe Lapu Lapu Festival in Vancouver, and similar festivals in the Philippines and around the world, take place every year to commemorate Lapu-Lapu, a national hero who resisted Spanish colonisation in the 1500s. Also known as Lapulapu, Lapu Lapu was an indigenous chief of Mactan, an island in the Philippines. In 1521, he and his men defeated Spanish forces led by Ferdinand Magellan and some of his native allies at the battle of Mactan, delaying Spanish occupation of the region for over 40 years. He is considered a hero in the modern-day Philippines, and monuments in his honour are common around the country. Several Filipino government organisations - such as the national police service - use his image on their seals. Lapu Lapu Day was officially recognised by the government of British Columbia in 2023. Filipinos form one of the largest immigrant groups in the province.\n\nWho were the victims?\n\nSo far, very little is known about the identity of those were were killed and wounded in the attack. In a brief news conference on Saturday, acting Vancouver police chief Steve Rai said that men, women and young people were among the victims. Their ages range from five to 65, he added. The attack has deeply affected Vancouver's tight-knit Filipino community. RJ Aquino, the head of the Filipino BC organisation, said that \"last night was extremely difficult and the community will feel this for a long time.\" \"We know that there's a lot of questions floating about and we don't have all the answers, but we want to tell everybody that we're grieving,\" he added.\n\nWho is the suspect?",

Counter Terrorism Policing North East said the \"isolated incident\" involving the women aged 19 and 31, happened on Otley Road, in the Headingley area, at about 14:47 BST on Saturday. One of the women was sent home from hospital earlier while the other, who underwent surgery, was now in a stable condition, police said. A 38-year-old man, who officers said was \"the key suspect\", remains in hospital in a critical condition, under police guard, after suffering a \"self-inflicted injury\".\n\nThe incident occurred on Otley Road in Headingley while people were taking part in the popular Otley Run pub crawl. Cordons around the scene on Otley Road were removed on Sunday evening.\n\nYappApp Two weapons were recovered from the scene, which were a crossbow and a firearm\n\nDet Ch Supt James Dunkerley said: \"The investigation continues and officers are working at pace to establish the full facts and circumstances of Saturday's incident. \"We are not currently seeking anyone else in connection with this matter, which has caused understandable concern. We believe it was an isolated incident.\" Alison Lowe, deputy mayor of West Yorkshire for policing and crime, said the man was being held under police guard.\n\n'We're here for you'\n\nShe said: \"The suspect injured themselves and is now in hospital under police guard so the threat has been eliminated.\" Lowe reassured the public and said there would be an increased police presence across Headingley in \"the coming days and weeks\". \"This is a very, very rare incident and the police know that the public are very frightened, so there is a much bigger police presence. \"I would be scared if I had witnessed or been close to an incident of that magnitude. \"All I can say to those women and girls is that we're here for you. We're increasing those patrols.\"\n\nBBC/Trudy Scanlon Vasileios Balampanos says the area is usually quiet, apart from students doing the Otley Run\n\nMP for Leeds Central and Headingley, Alex Sobel, said the incident raised concerns about the safety of the Otley Run. He said: \"We need to look at the numbers and see what we can do to ensure safety on the Otley Run. \"This is really serious and shocking and nobody foresaw that anything like this would happen, but we have had other issues, just because of the huge volume of people who come every Saturday and the growth in it. \"Because of this we're going to have to look really deeply at how Otley Run operates.\"\n\nBBC/Cathy Killick Police said officers were working \"at pace to establish the full facts and circumstances\" of the incident\n\nHeadingley resident Vasileios Balampanos described seeing the aftermath of the incident. He said he saw paramedics treating someone further up Otley Road and \"a couple of distressed individuals, students mostly\". \"It was quite scary,\" he said. \"Generally, this is a quiet area but we have plenty of people doing the Otley Run and going to the pub. It can get busy sometimes.\" Headingley councillor Abdul Hannan said his thoughts were with the victims and said the council was working closely with the police and reassuring the community. \"It's horrific,\" he said. \"There is a lot of footfall in that area, it is a busy stretch, especially on a Saturday. \"It is a tragedy what has taken place.\"\n\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",
